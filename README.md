# lcnimodules

I am moving these out into their own repositories! So look for them there. I may need to change names of things if there are already existing projects. I'll try to keep this updated with changes.

Useful python modules for the LCNI user base

slurmpy: submit jobs using slurm on the talapas data cluster. 

dicom2bids: convert dicom to bids; calls dcm2niix

niftiviewer: convenience functions for viewing nifti files in a Jupyter notebook. Very early in development, expect a lot of changes
