Useful python modules for the LCNI user base (others may also find them useful)

slurmpy: submit jobs to slurm on the talapas data cluster. 

dicom2bids: convert dicom to bids. 

niftiviewer: convenience functions for viewing nifti files in a Jupyter notebook. Very early in development, expect a lot of changes
