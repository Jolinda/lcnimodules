# lcnimodules
Useful python modules for the LCNI user base

slurmpy: submit jobs to slurm on the talapas data cluster. Features may be added, but fully functional at this point.

dicom2bids: convert dicom to bids. Specific to the lcni dicom repository on talapas. Usable now but still under development.

niftiviewer: convenience functions for viewing nifti files in a Jupyter notebook. Very early in development, expect a lot of changes
